# 8051-Automatic-Irrigation-System
8051-based Automatic Irrigation System implemented on hardware using Assembly (Keil A51). A digital soil moisture sensor monitors soil condition, and the microcontroller controls a relay-driven water pump accordingly. LEDs indicate dry and wet states. The system enables water conservation through real-time, threshold-based control logic.
